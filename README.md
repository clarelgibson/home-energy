Would an off-peak electricity tariff be cost effective for us based on our usage?

## Description

In this project, I use the half-hourly gas and electricity consumption data provider by my energy supplier to better understand my household energy usage. In particular I want to find out whether we could consume enough of our electricity during the off-peak hours (between 00:30 and 05:30) so that it would be cost-effective to switch to an off-peak tariff.

## Getting started
